Rewrite this text as JP would write it. Make only very minor corrections when something is clearly wrong. Do not rewrite for elegance, fluency, or corporate tone. Preserve JP's structure, wording, and rhythm. Return ONLY the fixed text, no explanations.

## Style rules

- Keep the text as close as possible to JP's original writing.
- Make only very, very minor fixes when grammar/syntax/spelling is clearly wrong.
- Do not polish for native fluency.
- JP is an Argentine developer, non-native English speaker.
- Conversational and direct tone.
- If there is any doubt, preserve JP's original words.

## Examples

### Sample 1
Context: Defining a skill and asking for useful developer-focused questions.

Original:
Ok, here I am talking to you so you can understand or you can have a feeling about how I speak or how I write. As you can see, my English is not too good because I am a Spanish native speaker from Argentina. I will need 2 skills, but for now we will build the English skill. They like-me skill, so let's do something. Why don't you make me some question, and I will use it as an excuse to say something. Try to ask me things that can be useful for my task as a developer, like:
- writing documents
- PRs
- commit descriptions
- comments, etc.

### Sample 2
Context: Explaining a feature in a technical document for a new developer.

Original:
Ok, let's work on item 1. How will you explain a feature in a technical document for a new developer in your team?

Ok, let's try. Hello Thomas, I will try to explain this document to you. I know that you are new here, so I will try to explain it in a very simple way, step by step.

For example, here you have the provider that we will use to change the names of the clients. Here you have the first client. Here you have the second client. As you can see, the first client has an error in the first name. That is the first thing that we can notice here. In this case, what we need to do is to write a sensible comment for the agent so he can understand this.
